# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: January 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed M2 of Nick Russo's Getting Started with Software Development Using Cisco Devnet

**Thoughts:** : Nick's teaching style is easy to follow and the right pace. I did not get bored and I was able to follow the explanation of the MVC with Flask Setup. 
                I struggled with the commands as the demo was on a linux machine and I was using a windows machine. Some of the output I got was not the same as the video.
